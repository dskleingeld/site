How to become a great software developer? While a Computer Science degree can help, it's not the answer though. I won't pretend I have it either, I do however tend to give out the same list of books whenever the subject comes up. 

I would suggest starting at the top, but start wherever you like. It's better to read anything then never start right? If you get tired of reading I added some related talks.
