\section{Summary}
I am a software engineer experienced in building async services. I work with a focus on maintainability. I have deployed to Linux hosts and have worked with tools like Docker, SystemD and HaProxy. My open source projects include a distributed file system and a macro to turn a struct into a typed database. Serving as chair of the Faculty Council, I have led meetings and helped shape University policy. I enjoy teaching my programming group to write beautiful code.

\section{Skills}
\subsection{Software Engineering}
My main objective when developing is to produce readable code that is easy to change, which I can then more easily turn into high performance code where needed. I have adopted \texthl{test driven development} as it makes refactoring less risky, meaning it is much easier to keep a clean and readable code-base. Building a \texthl{distributed} file system I learned behavior can change radically with load and the importance of testing under load.

\subsection{Programming Languages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Rust}: I love writing Rust code. I believe it has made me a better programmer, I have become more aware of object and reference \texthl{lifetimes} and how to use \texthl{concurrency} safely when using other languages. 
	\item \textbf{C++}: has major issues regarding memory safety. I try to mitigate this by using the standard library in debug mode, using \texthl{address sanitizer} and encapsulating resources where possible. 
	\item \textbf{Python}: I am a strong proponent of type hinting in Python as it helps linters detect more errors before run-time. I use Python for a wide variety of tasks ranging from data science to building \texthl{scaling cloud} systems.
	\item \textbf{Bash}: Because of its ubiquity I have become quite proficient at using Bash to automate DevOps tasks, such deployment and interactive monitoring of a cluster during testing. I would not, however, use the error-prone arcane wizardry of Bash outside of development and testing.
	\item \textbf{Lua}: I have used Lua to script a large \texthl{Neovim} plugin. I appreciate its performance, though found it is a challenge to structure code well.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{DevOps}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Linux}: I have used Linux on my desktop and servers since 2014. After trying Fedora and Debian, I settled on using Pop!\_OS as my daily driver, because it offers stability and LTS as well as up-to-date packages. 	
	\item \textbf{Sandboxing}: My services are sandboxed with \textbf{SystemD} instead of container engines such as \textbf{Docker} and \textbf{Podman}. I use these to simplify setting up reproducible builds and run-time environments.
	\item \textbf{Architecture}: I use a \textbf{micro-services} architecture for some of my larger projects . I use \textbf{HaProxy} for both HTTP and TCP TLS termination and routing.
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, I dabble in \textbf{async embedded} building a basic \myhref{https://github.com/dvdsk/rustyscopes}{oscilloscope}. Finally, I worked on a Neovim extension for grammar, spelling and style checker in strings and comments.\\
\smallskip
I have contributed code to various projects on \texthl{GitHub}.

\subsection{Other}
I served one year as \textbf{Chair of the Faculty Council} leading the council meetings and successfully negotiating to keep a number of courses available to all students.
I really value my years of giving demonstrations and \textbf{tours to the public} at the old observatory in Leiden and \textbf{training} groups of aspirant tour guides.\\
\smallskip
Recently I have started a small programming study group where I \textbf{teach} Rust and modern extendible Python to computer science students.
